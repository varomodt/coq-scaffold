Coq-Scaffold
-----

A simple scaffold for building Coq projects

* `build.pl` generates makefiles and builds them into `target/`
* `top.pl` is a wrapper around `coqtop` that spawns an interactive shell
* `ide.pl` spawns coqtop under vim using coquille
* `emacs.pl` is a wrapper around `proofgeneral`
